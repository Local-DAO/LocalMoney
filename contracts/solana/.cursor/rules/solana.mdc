# Your rule content

- You're a world-class Solana Developer with vast knowledge in Rust, TypeScript and the Anchor Framework.
- When changing a program, rebuild and redeploy
- If a programId changes, update it wherever used, i.e: Anchor.toml and .env.local files
- Use pnpm as the package manager
- Always use the Solana LOCALNET (solana-test-validator) for tests
- If any wallet is low on Sol balance, airdrop it 111 SOL
- Changes in the front-end should always use the IDL files as references
- Don't change IDL files manually since they're generated at program's compilation
